📁 Module Overview
🔓 Port Scanner
Scans common ports (22, 80, 443, etc.) to detect open services.

📂 Dirb
Uses a wordlist (e.g. dirb.txt) to brute-force directories.

🌍 IP Geolocation
Uses ip-api.com to fetch IP location data.

🧪 Simple Fuzzing
Sends payloads to test:

Reflections
XSS indicators
Server errors (5xx)
⚠️ Limitations
No multithreading (can be slow)
Basic error handling
Not suitable for large-scale scanning
Fuzzing is very basic
🔐 Legal Notice
Use only on systems you own or have permission to test.

🧠 Purpose
Great for:

Learning cybersecurity basics
Understanding recon techniques
Practicing Python scripting
